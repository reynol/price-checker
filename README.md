# odoo-price-checker

Odoo module to easily check/update product prices using the barcode scanner. 



The module was designed to give the user a dedicated module to check prices like in supermarkets. But thinking on make administrator life easier, I added a button to easily change prices. If the barcode is not found the user will be able to assign a product name and price  to it or if it do exists then it will be able to change those values.
